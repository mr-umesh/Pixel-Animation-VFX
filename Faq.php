                        HOW IS THE LIFE OF VFX ARTISTS?
                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion__item__content">
                        <p> It is very much a lifestyle of feast or famine. Sometimes there will be so much work that you don‚Äôt have enough hours in the day to get all your work done. As a consequence, you make a boatload of money in overtime. Other times, no one is hiring and you run the risk of being out of work for months at a time if you aren‚Äôt careful. Or, if there is work, your hours get cut back to 3/4 or 1/2 time.
                        Another issue is that VFX work goes where ever the most aggressive subsidies are. A few years ago, that was London. Now many of the studios are setting up shop in Vancouver, Canada. Don‚Äôt be surprised about moving to a completely different country every year or two. If you are (very) young and single, this can be exciting. But it wears thin quickly. I have friends who left the industry in their late twenties because they were just becoming too exhausted from the constant moving.
                        There are very few full time positions in VFX; expect to be an un-benefitted contract employee for the next 10-15 years.
                        In the worst of shops, you will be heavily pressured to work unpaid overtime. Only work in a place like this if you have no other choice. As Admiral Ackbar says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a trap!‚Äù
                        The reason for all these things is because the VFX industry does fixed bids in a creative industry, which means unexpected revisions are frequent; thus VFX shops often have slim profit margins (if they are even making money at all) and this trickles down to the artists. People are the most expensive asset of any company, including VFX. So, laying off people at the end of every show and never offering benefits allows shops to (theoretically) stay afloat.
                        In short, the industry as a whole is broken. You may get an opportunity to work at a studio that treats their employees great. Don‚Äôt let this experience fool you; they are the exception, not the rule. I personally expect the industry to implode on itself in the next decade and I hope it will then rebuild itself as something more sustainable. Only time will tell.
                        On a positive note, there are a lot of great people you can work with. It is one of the only reasons I have stuck around as long as I have. Also, the work itself is usually very interesting and fun. But, as an employee you will be treated pretty poorly, sometimes because your boss or manager is a jerk, but most often because they are just trying to stay in the black.
                        My advice? Look to animation or video games. Many aspects of the work are similar, but you get treated far better because the studios are usually creating their own content, and so benefit financially from the product‚Äôs success. This, in turn, trickles down to the employees who are seen as essential assets and are treated well compared to VFX artists.</p>

                        WHAT IS THE MONTHLY SALARY OF AN ANIMATOR, VFX IN INDIA?
                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion__item__content">
                    <p>Absolutely Visual Effects Artist can have a great career and also very 
                        high salary which is the most attractive part of this profession. Salaries
                        are in the range 8-15 K for freshers. But after experience in MNCs like Pixar, 
                        Technicolour (Bangalore), Rythm and Hues (Hyderabad) salaries are more than software engineers. 
                        Actually there are some guys with 5 years of experiences who are getting 70 K per month.
                        Well if you are a hardworker and passionate you will have a handsome income,
                        because hard work is always paid of whatsoever be the career. Remember, 
                        your Career is a resultant of your knowledge combined with your passion and expression ability.
                        And VFX is really a cool career because VFX industry demand is increasing in India also abroad. 
                        In India,there are already many visual effects studios that provide visual effects for Bollywood
                        films and some of them now provide visual effects for Hollywood as well. The demand for more 
                        studios is only going to increase over time as the demand for visual effects increases and India‚Äôs 
                        capability for producing it improves.
                        </p>
                        <p>Outlook:According to the BLS, the demand for multimedia artists and animators 
                        was expected to grow about six percent, slower than the average for all professions, 
                        from 2012-2022. This anticipated growth was attributed to an expected increase in demands 
                        for special effects in the film industry and graphics for mobile technologies. Incidentally, 
                        the film industry was the largest and best-paying employer of visual effects artists in 2013. 
                        The creation of computer-generated animation in the scientific research and design was also
                        expected to add opportunities for visual effects artists.
                        </p>
                        <p>Requirements:Students need to have a firm understanding of standard software tools of 
                        the industry, such as Houdini, Nuke, RenderMan, Adobe CS5, mental ray, and Autodesk Maya.
                        Although a degree is not necessarily required for jobs in this field, a bachelor‚Äôs degree

                        With 3-5 years of experience, they can earn Rs. 30K ‚Äì 40K. 
                        A well-experienced animator who has a good portfolio of excellent animation work could easily get Rs.

                        you need to make an effort for you to get to a high paying level.

                        HOW DO I START A VFX STUDIO?
                    </div>
                    <div class="accordion__item__content">
                        <p>The first question you have to ask yourself is how big is your team? The bigger your team the bigger and more challenging the work you can take on, but you will also need more infrastructure to support your operation ‚Äì a big enough office to hold your crew, air conditioning for the machinery and so on. You then have to start thinking about things like toilet facilities, cleaning staff etc.
                        However, let‚Äôs assume that you‚Äôre starting out with a couple of friends ‚Äì a setup small enough that you can run it out of someone‚Äôs house. The first order of business will be getting your first job and then delivering on time on budget ‚Äì this is often the thing that catches people out, sure your work looks great but if you miss the delivery or blow the budget then you won‚Äôt get any more work. It‚Äôs advisable to start modestly ‚Äì aim at something that you know you can deliver and where the client is confident that you can do so. Small independent movies, TV shows and possibly commercials are likely to be where the work is to be found. Be brutally realistic about what‚Äôs achievable ‚Äì it‚Äôs amazing how many people come unstuck because they can‚Äôt do basic maths, ie if it takes one person a week to do this bit of work then how many people do I need (or how long for one person) to do ten times that much.
                        It‚Äôs worth bearing in mind that as a new outfit without any proven track record of delivering the goods you will probably have to be able to work cheaper or faster than other established shops ‚Äì the clients will know that and negotiate accordingly. On the other hand, lower-budget jobs are often where you get a higher degree of creative freedom and input.
                        Be professional ‚Äì nobody cares how good your work is if there‚Äôs no one answering the phones or returning emails. When the client calls to find out when the shots are delivering make sure you give them a sensible and timely answer. Make sure you have someone in your team who is taking care of business, keeping on top of the admin of the job and the company ‚Äì most start out VFX companies die in the first 24 months due to cashflow problems.
                        In summary: start modestly, don‚Äôt overreach, be prepared to negotiate with clients and make sure you have a solid producer/manager.
